  sentences:
  - Yahoooo, I'm free! Name's Ivan-Tory, I'm here to help however I can.
  - Let's take a look at what those humans did to our village...[ZOOM]
  - ...Ugh. What a mess, but not all hope is lost, the rest of the villagers are
    still out there.
  - They are recovering in seed form, give them a cosy nook and some care and they'll
    sprout back to life.
  - Oh! That reminds me, while I was stuck underground I found this seed.
  - Let's try planting it in that nice patch by the old house. We could use all the
    help we can get.[PAN]
