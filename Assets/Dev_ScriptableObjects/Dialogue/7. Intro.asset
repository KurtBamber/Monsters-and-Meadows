  sentences:
  - Phew. That was close! It looks like our little builder friend is all tried out.
  - Everytime a monster performs an action they use energy if their energy gets too
    low they must head to a house to recover.
  - Monsters are happy to sleep in any type of house however, if you build their
    favourite house they will recover much faster!
  - Aha. It seems that one of the fleeing humans dropped a seed for a monster. Pick
    it up and give it a plant.
  - If you click on a resource(trees or rocks) with the correct monster type selected
    you will begin to gather that resource.[END]
